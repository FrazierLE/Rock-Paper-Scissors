Learning Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  1. DRY JavaScript
  2. Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
  I have found that the solo projects have provided the most valuable learning experience when dealing with my technical skills, and so building an application from the ground up was a really impactful experience.
  Getting the application to work fairly quickly was a huge win, but then the refactoring part of it was more difficult.  
  CSS came fairly easy.

Challenges:
  Figuring out how to use event delegation was a challenge.
  My origin goal when starting was just to get the game working, and then I would go back to condense the code I wrote. Refactoring is time consuming.
  Another challenge was staying on track. I was trying to figure out which direction to go for the difficult game version, and I kept going down rabbit     holes. I definitely learned a lot from the different paths I took, but it wasn't necessary for this particular project.
